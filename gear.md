## Mobile Phone

The device I use the most!
Bought it in January of 2022 at 300â‚¬ (unlocked). Greate hardware for the
buck but the stock system is "garbage" although it has some nice privacy related features.

### Some apps I use:

- ~~Neo Store (Client for F-Droid)~~ Droid-ify
- ~~Mull (Fork of Firefox with some hardening)~~ Fennec
- Bitwarden (Password manager)
- Moshidon (fork of the official Mastodon mobile client with some nice features)
- Proton App Suite (Mail, Calendar, VPN, Drive)
- Aegis (2FA)
- Nekogram (Telegram client fork)
- ReVanced Manager (YouTube patcher)
- NewPipe (for downloads or when yt is broken)

## Laptop
