    <span>Hi, my name is</span>
    <h1>Tiago Carmo</h1>
    <p>
      I'm a self-taught app and web developer from Portugal that loves FOSS and
      privacy. I'm currently studying computer science.
    </p>
    <p>
      I create open source Android apps with the prime objective being stability
      and accesbility. I also do some web related stuff like this website and a
      flash games website. When I'm bored I sometimes code random stuff on
      Python or C.
